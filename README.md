Starter code was and the full code can be found in [menu.py](https://github.com/mikeyms1/python-challenge-1/blob/main/menu.py)

Edits were made to allow a user to select from different categories of food, different types of food items, and the quantity.  The program will continue to loop until the user has completed their order.  When complete a receipt is printed for the user itemizing the ordered items, price, and total money owed.

The program uses while loops, if statements, match:case statements, list comprension, and various print formatting. Error checking was added to assist the users if wrong entries are made for items.
