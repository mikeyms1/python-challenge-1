# Interactive Ordering System in Python

Starter [code](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m2/lms/starter/M2_Starter_Code.zip) was provided for an interactive ordering system.  Edits were made and the final code can be found in [menu.py](https://github.com/mikeyms1/python-challenge-1/blob/main/menu.py)

## Edits made to original code:

Edits were made to allow a user to select from different categories of food, different types of food items, and the quantity.  The program will continue to loop until the user has completed their order.  When complete a receipt is printed for the user itemizing the ordered items, price, and total money owed.

The program uses while loops, if statements, match:case statements, list comprension, and various print formatting. Error checking was added to assist the users if wrong entries are made for items.
